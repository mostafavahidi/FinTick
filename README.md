# FinTick
Flask-Python-Bootstrap. Finance - Tech (FinTech) Web Application for analyzing different stock ticker symbols (hence, FinTick)!

The purpose of this project is to familiarize myself with building web applications and financial analyzation tools.
This application will allow the user to enter a stock name or ticker symbol in the home page and easily view multiple resulting
values for different financial analytical calculations.

When the user looks up a stock, the following values are calculated (targeted towards value investors):

1. Earnings per share (EPS)
2. Price to earnings (P/E) ratio
3. Price to earnings ratio to growth ratio (PEG)
4. price to book value ratio (P/B)
5. Dividend payout ratio (DPR)
6. Dividend yield
7. Debt to Equity ratio (D/E)
8. Free Cash Flow
9. Price to Earnings to Growth ratio (PEG)
